# Hi, I'm Fagner

The link you received provides an overview of my background, what you can expect from me, and what I expect from you.

## Background

I have experience working with small companies and large companies. I've been on teams which practiced TDD, Event-Driven Design, Domain Driven Design, Mob Programming, Pair Programming, and working solo. I've also been on teams owning a codebase which had no tests, they never interacted with the business, and didn't know any other way of working.

I also have a [blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@fagnerbrack) which you can find posts about forgotten fundamentals of software. I post **all links I read** on my [Reddit account](https://reddit.com/user/fagnerbrack) and [HackerNews account](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=fagnerbrack). I have also contributed to a few Open Source projects such as [impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js), [jquery-cookie](https://github.com/carhartl), and [js-cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie).

I've been through a few cycles in the software industry where [Old Is the New New](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbgsfeGvg3E), not as much as those with many decades of experience. Whatever you're doing, it's probably the same thing I've seen before, only with a new name.

## What You Can Expect From Me

## Values

In the spirit of the [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and the [Software Crafters](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) manifesto. Here are my principles, with the same caveat of:

> While there is value in the items on the right, I value the items on the left more

1. Pragmatism over Purism
2. Quality over Quantity
3. Impact over Income
