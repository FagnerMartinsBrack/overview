# Hi, I'm Fagner

The link you received provides an overview of my background, what you can expect from me, and what I expect from you.

## Background

I have experience working with small companies and large companies. I've been on teams which practiced TDD, Event-Driven Design, Domain Driven Design, Event-Sourcing, Message-Oriented Architectures, Mob Programming, Pair Programming, and working individually. I've built profitable (and not profitable) systems end-to-end from scratch, with and without frameworks, either as a solo developer Startup or together as a team. I've also been on teams owning a codebase which had no tests, they never interacted with the business, and didn't know any other way of working.

My main interest and background is Software Engineering.

However, I'm passionate and given my [multipotentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotentiality#:~:text=A%20multipotentialite%20is%20a%20person,calling%E2%80%9D%20the%20way%20specialists%20do.) I also have extensive experience on a diversity set of roles within software development. For that reason, I also have some knowledge and experience in Psychology, User Experience (UX), Customer Support, Public Relations, Product Management / Customer Behaviour Analysis, Finance / Cloud Billing Management, and Marketing.

I **DO NOT** have significant knowledge or experience, but I'm keen to acquire it, in Machine Learning and Strategic Decision-Making. I **DO NOT** have interest in Framework-Specific API Syntax, Computer Science Puzzles, and Sales.

I also have a [personal blog](https://fagnerbrack.com) which is a non-profit initiative to write about forgotten fundamentals of software. I post **30% of all links I read** on my [Reddit account](https://reddit.com/user/fagnerbrack) and [HackerNews account](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=fagnerbrack). I have also contributed to a few Open Source projects such as [impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js), [jquery-cookie](https://github.com/carhartl), and [js-cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie).

I've been through a few cycles in the software industry where [Old Is the New New](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbgsfeGvg3E). Whatever you're doing, it's probably the same thing I've seen before, only with a new name.

## Self-Management

One interesting thing that people told me in my previous roles is that I don't need to be managed. Maybe that's because I have experience on working in teams with diverse skillsets and personalities. For that reason, I've developed the ability to predict potential interpersonal issues that either myself or somebody else may encounter. That allows me to help raising expectations clearly and early to the relevant stakeholders, including to "manage up".

However, depending on the personality differences of each peer and their values or ways of working, reaching common ground can take as little as days and as much as weeks. It's better to be aware of [Tuckman's curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development) and to not give up once the Storming/Norming phase start to kick in.

## Personality

Below is an overview of my personality traits according to the Big 5:

## What I expect from the company and my peers

* To allow me to learn and fail safely, as much as I'll allow you too.
* To provide clear processes, practices, accountability and responsibility.
* To listen and make feedback occur as often as possible and to be as specific as possible.
* To ask for clarification on topics and interactions between us that are confusing.
* To ask me questions to help you make better choices, or allow me to ask you questions to help me make better choices.

## What the company and my peers can expect from me

* To work actively towards reducing my own [Truck Factor](http://www.agileadvice.com/2005/05/15/agilemanagement/truck-factor/).
* To understand the full picture of the problem and how it relates to the relevant stakeholders before I can help developing a solution.
* To respect your opinions and support your decisions, even if I disagree with them.
* To help in other responsibilities I might have skills to assist, as long as it's temporary and don't consume the majority of my coding job.

## Values

In the spirit of the [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and the [Software Crafters](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) manifesto. Here are my values, with the same essential caveat of:

> While there is value in the items on the right, I value the items on the left more

1. Company Values over Team Values over Individual Values
2. Solving Problems over Applying Recipes
3. Quality over Quantity
4. Impact over Income
5. Mentoring over Managing
6. Forecast over Estimation
7. Fundamentals over Implementations
8. Products over Projects
9. Knowledge over Tooling
10. Lean Approaches over Big Bang
